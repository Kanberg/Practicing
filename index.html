        <h2>The main ecological issues.</h2>
        <p>Currently, the greatest ecological challenges are <strong>environmental pollution, climate change,<br> deforestation, and biodiversity loss.</strong> </p>

          <h3>Environmental pollution.</h3>
          <p>Environmental pollution is among the <strong>greatest</strong> environmental challenges. It leads to ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, water and air pollution,<br>accelerated climate change, public health risks and so on.<br>
          I could list a multitude of issues stemming from environmental pollution, but doing so would take too long. Environmental pollution is the process by which substances or<br>factors are enter the natural world and disrupt its balance. These may include chemicals, waste, noise, radiation, or even excenssive resource exploitation.</p>
          <h3>How we can fix it</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Give up plastic, or at least reduce its use.</li>
            <li>Switch to renewable energy.</li>
            <li>Reduce emissions and waste.</li>
            <li>Separate and rcycle waste.</li>
            <li>Plant trees and restore nature.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Climate change.</h3>
          <p>Climate change is dangeerous because it leads to extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, floods. It causes sea-level rise, threatening coastal areas,<br>disrupts ecosystems, reduces crop yields, creates shortages of food and water, and increases risks to human health, including diseases and stress.<br>
            Climate change is the long-term alteration of Earth's average weather patterns, caused by both natural processes and human activities such as greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation.</p>
