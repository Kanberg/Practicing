        <h2>The main ecological issues.</h2>
        <p>Currently, the greatest ecological challenges are <strong>environmental pollution, climate change,<br> deforestation, and biodiversity loss.</strong> </p>

          <h2>Environmental pollution.</h2>
          <p>Environmental pollution is among the <strong>greatest</strong> environmental challenges. It leads to ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, water and air pollution,<br>accelerated climate change, public health risks and so on.<br>
          I could list a multitude of issues stemming from environmental pollution, but doing so would take too long. Environmental pollution is the process by which substances or<br>factors enter the natural world and disrupt its balance. These may include chemicals, waste, noise, radiation, or even excessive resource exploitation.</p>
          <h3>How we can fix it.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Give up plastic, or at least reduce its use.</li>
            <li>Switch to renewable energy.</li>
            <li>Reduce emissions and waste.</li>
            <li>Separate and recycle waste.</li>
            <li>Plant trees and restore nature.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Climate change.</h2>
          <p>Climate change is dangerous because it leads to extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, floods. It causes sea-level rise, threatening coastal areas,<br>disrupts ecosystems, reduces crop yields, creates shortages of food and water, and increases risks to human health, including diseases and stress.<br>
            Climate change is the long-term alteration of Earth's average weather patterns, caused by both natural processes and human activities such as greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation.</p>
          <h3>How we can fix it.</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Promote sustainable lifestyles.</li>
            <li>Switch to renewable energy.</li>
            <li>Protect and restore forests.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Deforestation and biodiversity loss.</h2>
          <p>Deforestation and biodiversity loss are equally pressing. Deforestation is dangerous because it leads to biodiversity loss, intensification of climate change,<br>soil erosion, disruption of the water cycle and damage to local communities.  Deforestation is a large-scale removal of forests that often leads to transformation of soils into the agricultural, urbanized or industrial territories.<br>
          Biodiversity loss leads to reduced resilience to climate change, loss of natural resources, increased risk of disease spread and instability of food supply.<br> Biodiversity loss is dangerous because it devastates ecosystems, deprives people of natural resources, reduces resilience to climate change, increases the risk of disease transmission, and makes the food supply unstable.
          </p>
          <h3>How we can fix it.</h3>
          <ol type="A" start="1">
            <li>Reduce deforestation and protect existing forests.</li>  
            <li>Restore forests.</li>
            <li>Create and support nature reserves to preserve rare species.</li>
            <li>Reduce pollution and emissions.</li>
            <li>Promote sustainable use of resources.</li>
            <li>Increase ecological literacy and public awareness.</li>
          </ol>  
            <h2>To Conclude</h2>
            <p>Ecological challenges are not a joke, and fixing them demands patience and effort. But we can do it if we do not give up. See you next time!</p>
